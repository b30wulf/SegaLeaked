# If the transparent pixel percentage in a skin is higher than this, player will be kicked.
# IMPORTANT: Keep in mind this is NOT for the visible parts of the skin, it is for the entire skin texture, which
# normally already contains a good amount of empty pixels.
percentage: 75

# Options are "kick" and "block".
# kick: Kicks the player if the skin is invisible.
# block: Blocks the player from changing their skin in-game to an invisible one, and sets their skin to
#  default_skin if they join with an invisible skin.
behaviour: "block"

# Only used if behaviour is "block".
# The player's skin will be set to the skin specified here if they join with an invisible skin.
# If left empty, random bytes will be used.

# If behaviour is "block", this is the message sent to the player.
# If behaviour is "kick", this is the message shown to the player on the disconnection screen.
